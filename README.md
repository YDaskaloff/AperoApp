# AperoApp
A website for browsing through bikes for rent. It offers an admin panel for editing and adding bikes and members.

This project was meant to fulfill the needs of a voluntary organisation in my local town, whose aim is to provide inexpensive
bikes and maintenance for students. Unfortunatelly the organisation is soon to be disbanded and so this website will never 
come to life.

However, it was a great exercise working on it and an honor to serve such a noble cause.

The website is essentially a Single Page Application, built using Angular 8 and .NET Core 3.0. It also uses Bootstrap and other
third-party libraries to give it life and style.

What was of great help and guidance through the process of building this project is this Udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/

After going halfway though with the course, I decided to try and create something of my own with the purpose of better
understanding the contents of the lectures. Watching the tutorials was very educational but nothing teaches better than practice.

This project isn't dead yet. It is on pause now, because I am diverting my attention towards other technologies.
